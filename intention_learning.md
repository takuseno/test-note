## intention learning via Non-parametric Deep Reinforcement Learning

this paper proposes adaptation method with semi-autonomous teleoperated robot

We must tackle the problem of adapting user intention in various situation

In shared autonomy, shared autonomy, deep reinforcement learning


### problems
- deep reinforcement learning
	- requires pre-trained models
- deep tamer
	- not shared control

### contributions
- introducing non-parametric deep reinforcement learning framework
	- not requires domain specific pre-trained models
- dealing with shared control and non-shared control
	- semi-autonomous robot requires both control
  
### why non-parametric deep reinforcement learning?
- less data to train
- penalty for interaction
	-  poor sample efficiency
  		- needs quick adaptation
